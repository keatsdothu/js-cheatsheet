# Javascript (ES6+) Cheatsheet

## So, where's the cheat sheet?

The meat and potatoes of this repo are located in the _js-cheatsheet.js_ file.

## Topics included

* Fizzbuzz solutions
* Factory functions
* Object composition
* Prototype delegation vs. classical inheritance (needs examples)
* Promises
* Using Quokka
* Generators
* Regular expressions
* Fetch API (needs a Promise.all example)
* Functions, objects and this (still working on it)

## Installation (so you can muck about and play with things in it)

* Clone the repo.
* Run _index.html_.
* (node-fetch is only needed if you're running this in nodeJS, or want to see fetch results right in the browser in Quokka.)
* (Quokka isn't needed either, but strongly suggested to speed up your workflow. :))
